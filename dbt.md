# dbt

Dbt is designed to solve for the T part of ETL, by working on raw data already present in a data warehouse. It provides less functionality compared to other OSS ETL orchestration tools such as Airflow, Luigi, But this comes with the advantage of dbt being extremely simple to understand and run compared to other OSS ETL orchestration tools especially for a non engineer.
